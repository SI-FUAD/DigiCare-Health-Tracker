## 📌 Project Summary

This was a collaborative project developed by a team of four members. The original idea and most of the early functional planning were contributed by me. Each member built separate core modules, and one teammate later integrated all logic and completed the frontend using CSS and Bootstrap.

> ❌ GitHub was not used during the development phase. Collaboration was done via Discord, Google Meet, in-person lab work, and social media.
