## üìñ Project Overview

DigiCare was created by a team of four students. The initial idea for the system and most of its early design decisions were contributed by me. Each team member contributed basic functional modules, and the final integration ‚Äî including frontend layout (HTML/CSS/Bootstrap) and UI enhancements ‚Äî was completed by one team member based on everyone's individual components.

### üîß Tech Stack:
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
- **Backend**: Python (Flask), SQLAlchemy
- **Database**: MySQL (schema created manually via SQL commands)

> GitHub was not used during development. This submission has been uploaded retroactively for portfolio/archive purposes.
